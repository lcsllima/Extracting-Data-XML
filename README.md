# Extracting-Data-XML-JSON
Hello people, there is some of my codes, extracting data from a XML with Python (using Regular Expression or Not). I've done this whole repository during a MOOC, "Programming for Everybody" by University of Michigan. At Coursera.  So there is folders with the same name because i've done the same code a few times. So, if you want, look the last code (i will put a bigger number at the end of the name.)  To visualize/use you just need to have Python in your machine, and a IDE.

At the GEODATA Folder, we work with JSON.
